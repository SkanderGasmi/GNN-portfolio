    "Welcome to the NVIDIA DLI _Introduction to Graph Neural Networks_ lab. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are models designed to perform inference on unstructured data described by graphs. For different segments and industries, GNNs find suitable applications such as molecular analysis, drug discovery and repurposing, predicting stock market developments, thermodynamics, and even modeling human brain connectomes. In this lab, you will learn concepts such as graph data manipulation, message passing on graphs, graph convolution with spatial filtering, and multilayer GNNs. We'll also walk through the process of creating GNN-based classifiers using the [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/) and accelerating it on NVIDIA GPUs."

    "For this hands-on lab, we use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to manage our environment.  The [JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html) is a dashboard that provides access to interactive iPython notebooks, as well as the folder structure of our environment and a terminal window into the Ubuntu operating system. The first view you will see includes a **menu bar** at the top, a **file browser** in the **left sidebar**, and a **main work area** that is initially open to this \"introduction\" notebook. \n",

    "* The file browser can be navigated just like any other file explorer. A double click on any of the items will open a new tab with its content. \n",
    "* The main work area includes tabbed views of open files that can be closed, moved, and edited as needed. \n",
    "* The notebooks, including this one, consist of a series of content and code **cells**. To execute code in a code cell, press `Shift+Enter` or the `Run` button in the menu bar above, while a cell is highlighted. Sometimes, a content cell will get switched to editing mode. Executing the cell with `Shift+Enter` or the `Run` button will switch it back to a readable form.\n",
    "* To interrupt cell execution, click the `Stop` button in the menu bar or navigate to the `Kernel` menu, and select `Interrupt Kernel`. \n",
    "* We can use terminal commands in the notebook cells by prepending an exclamation point/bang(`!`) to the beginning of the command. "
